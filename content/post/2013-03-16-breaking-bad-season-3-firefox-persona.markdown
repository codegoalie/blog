<p>I just submitted this to the persona site. If you love Breaking Bad as much as I do and can't wait for Mozilla to approve it (I don't even know how long it takes), there are <a href='http://www.getpersonas.com/en-US/demo_create_3'>instructions about adding your own custom Persona from Mozilla</a>.
<p>In Brief:
First download these images:
<a href="http://chrismar035.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BB_top_header.jpg">BB_top_header.jpg</a>
<a href="http://chrismar035.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/BB_footer.png">BB_footer.png</a><BR>
Then, if you don't have the Personas add-on, <a href='http://www.getpersonas.com'>go here</a> to get it. After restarting Firefox, right click on the lil' fox in the lower left of Firefox and from Preferences, check Show Custom Persona in Menu. Then click the fox again and choose Custom > Edit. Select these Images: Header: BB_top_header.jpg; Footer: BB_footer.png. I used white for the text color and a dark green for the accent color. Click Ok.

That's it! Enjoy the Breaking Bad awesomeness!!
