A former coworker of mine over 8 years ago put this image into my head that has
never left. He was working as my manager at the time and he had an upcoming
large, foundational shifting feature that he wanted to let me know was coming. He
said "Don't do anything right now, but just put this in your noodler and see
what comes out."

He went on to explain that a former boss of _his_ introduced the idea of the
noodler to him. Now, I'm not your boss (I can confidently say that because I'm
no ones boss as of this writing ;) ), but I'd still like to share this image
with you that's helped me so much and I've never been able to shake.

If you haven't guessed by now, the noodler is the back part of your brain. Back
near the subconscious, it's like a rock tumbler. It's always spinning and
tumbling ideas without conscious effort. You just throw raw stuff into it and
in a few days or so, see what pops out. Sometimes it's just a smoother rock and
sometimes it's a true gem.

I like this metaphor for a few reasons. First, it's a pretty vivid, concrete
concept. I always imagine that red, kid's science kit version of a rock tumbler
that I always wanted. Now I have one and it's turning half-baked, super
hazy concepts into novel, actionable ideas.

Second, it's an escape hatch. Do this one easy thing, make progress, done for
the day. Take something off your plate. You can rest easier knowing that
something, somewhere is happening, but you don't need to spend active energy on
it, right now. Wash the dishes and think about the birds outside. Mow the lawn
and listen to that podcast. It's OK. Some other part of you has got this.

Lastly, it works. Not all the time. But more often than not, something comes to
me and I can make a small step, or a bigger leap. And if it doesn't, typically,
I'm no worse off.

Happy noodling!!
