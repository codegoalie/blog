I was recently having a conversation about Pull Request reviews with a colleague
of mine and I mentioned that when I'm ready to look at code for a PR, I review
one commit at a time in order. After a confused pause, she asked how I could
get the full context by only looking at one commit at a time. I supposed to her
that perhaps the full context is not what facilitates a better review. Instead,
we should follow the journey the developer who opened the PR has set out for us
through their commits.

I have many more thoughts on this subject, but I'd like to hear yours too. Email
me at chris@codegoalie.com and let me know what you think about the above
supposition. Possible? Nonsensical? Outright dumb? :)

Here's to your next magical PR journey!
