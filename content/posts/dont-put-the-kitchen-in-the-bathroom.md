As I was showering this morning and hungry for breakfast, I had the notion of
putting a kitchen in the bathroom. This is intuitively a bad idea, but as
software developers, we must protect the integrity of the product, house in this
case, for all use cases; not just morning shower hungers.

A case for moving the kitchen to the shower can be made compelling. I'm often
hungry multiple times a day. It would save me many ~clicks~ steps to not have to
go out to the kitchen whenever I'm hungry. If you just put the kitchen here, it
would solve my use case perfectly.

Having the life-long experience with homes and houses, we intuitively know that
kitchens aren't in the bathroom. With a little thought, it's easy to see holes
in the bathroom-kitchen plan. There are definitely sanitation concerns with
having bathroom activities and kitchen activities coexisting. When (we were
allowed to) have people over, they often congregate in the kitchen. Congregating
in the bathroom would require a special type of friend group.

This is how we must think as software developers. We cannot take all requests at
face value or gospel truth, but walk them back to the root causes and build up
solutions based on first principles. In practice, we don't usually have a
lifetime of experience to help make these calls. Additionally, they are
typically much much more subtle. Many feature requests sound like great ideas
(many are great ideas too). It's our jobs not to just build the features, but to
guard the system as a whole. We watch out for it. We foster it. We protect it.

I encourage us all to stop before implementing that next feature request and ask
questions. Get to the root of the request. Why do we want this request? What
problem were you having when you thought to ask for this? Then work from there
to find a solution that's __as simple as possible, but no more simple__. Oh, you
were hungry while in the bathroom. We could bring food from the kitchen into the
bathroom for you. We could move the kitchen closer to the bathroom. Or what if
we had a quick way to get to the kitchen from the bathroom? Would a secret
passage work? Yes! A secret passage is always the answer! ;)

I'll grab the candelabra. You push on the third tile from the right. Adventure
is out there (and bagels)!
